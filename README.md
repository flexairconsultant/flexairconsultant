- 👋 Hi, I’m @flexairconsultant thank you for looking at my profile. I've been a programmer for several years but got my start in technology doing component level
     electronic repair.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in several languages but python is my favorite. Mostly I consider myself to be language independant because I consider myself
      capable of learning any language quickly. As long as the reason to switch languages from one I know to one I don't is valid I'm for it. 
      I also enjoy billiards, travel, woodworking and nature hikes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many of the services provided by the main cloud providers. I believe in staying on top of current skills and will read books about
      topics I'm already well versed, currently reading "introducing python: modern computing in simple packages" by Bill Lubanovic. My most recent Udemy course
      is about docker and kubernetes. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are challenging and will make a big impact. I've spent many years doing the standard programming stuff like reports
      and ETL and now want to do something greater. I'm very interested in self driving cars, A.I to help people, Machine Learning for the diagnosis of 
      cancer and other conditions, home automation, drone remote mapping, drones delivery, and autonomous machines doing remote exploring.
